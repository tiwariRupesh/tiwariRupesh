**Spring Cloud Config Server.**

Spring Cloud Config Server is used to provide server-side and client-side support for externalized configuration in a distribute system.
        
 So when you have multiple microservices, and you want to easily control the configuration for all of them at one go - youâ€™ll mostly be looking at Spring Cloud Config Server. 
 
 **Why spring cloud config server is needed ?**
 
 But the main problem is that Configuration properties are tied to the codebase or statically packaged, so any changes in the properties file means rebuilding and redeploying the application. 
 
 So, somehow, we need a technology that maintains all properties, and if any properties are changed, it will pick up the changes and reflect them without an application rebuild or restart.
